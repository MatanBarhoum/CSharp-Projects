# C# Report System With Database

<img src="Example.gif">
<br>
After doing my first Database project, and doing the same project without database (with datagridview, which was deleting all the data after the program was closed)
<br>
I've worked to make the same Reporting System, in which we can insert the report nubmer, a message and even a image with load function. 
<br>
Everything is saved to the database (using sql server 19), and can be accessed.
<br>
This project helped me to learn alot about the SQL Commands and how to execute, and how to perfome SQL tasks with GUI forms.
<br>
For example - to delete a varchar (string) from SQL we need to use 'string' and not string. Using \' + string + '\ I overcome the problem that the string was without quotation marks.
<br>
This project can be translated into full working projects for a lot of projects, small companies and even bigger ones.
