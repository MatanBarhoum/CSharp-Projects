# CSharp-Projects

A mobile coffee maker machine written in c#, mainly to develop skills and work with classes and methods.
There is also a admin panel to check money and resources like milk and coffee. To enter the admin panel enter '123' when you are asked to pick a coffee.
There is a class to calculate the exchange and using if statement to check the money. Also, there is a while loop to be worked if the user entered the first place a lower amount of money then required, the while loop will keep asking him to put money until the amount of money is equal to the coffee price. if the amount is equal or higher, he will get exchange and the while loop will break.

Beginner project.
