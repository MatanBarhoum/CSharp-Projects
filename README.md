# CSharp-Projects

A mobile coffee maker machine written in c#, mainly to develop skills and work with classes and methods.
There is also a admin panel to check money and resources like milk and coffee. To enter the admin panel enter '123' when you are asked to pick a coffee.
There is a class to calculate the exchange using if statement which will check the money. Also, there is a while loop to check if the user entered in the first place a lower amount of money then required, the while loop will keep asking him to put money until the amount of money is equal to the coffee price. if the amount is equal or higher, he will get exchange and the while loop will break.

The amount of milk and coffee will decrease every time coffee is been made. the machine will be calling each time for a method to check if there is enough milk and coffee, if isn't it will not let the user continue.

Beginner project.
