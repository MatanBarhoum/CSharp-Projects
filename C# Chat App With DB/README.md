# C# Chat Application with DB + login \ register
Chatty App has been developed as a way to communicate within a intranet (Without an internet connection). Then, We can use it like a whatsapp in work and talk. <br>
This is mainly because we barely touch the phone, and as a funny joke between friends at work. :) <br>
Use it as you like, Code as code, App as App (exe in the debug/bin folder).
