# C# Flappy Bird Game - Improved 
<img src="Exmaple.gif">
<br>
What changed from my previous Flappy Bird C# game :
<br>
1. New class for handling speeding increasing every time the score increased by 5 (if score % 5 == 0)
<br>
2. better Physics (gravity and pipespeed).
<br>
3. Random spawning of pipe (up and down).
<br>

<h1>To DO</h1>
1. Random top and bottom pipe position to make it harder!
