# C# Flappy Bird Game - Improved 
<img src="Example.gif">
<br>
What changed from my previous Flappy Bird C# game :
<br>
1. New class for handling speeding increasing every time the score increased by 5 (if score % 5 == 0)
<br>
2. better Physics (gravity and pipespeed).
<br>
3. Random spawning of pipe (up and down).
